I love the play board games and Codenames is one of my favorites. When I first started programming, I made a console version of the game in Java to practice what I learned in class.

When I started learning web development, I realized that the visual medium of the web would allow for an even better version.

Currently, the game requires all players to be around the same computer. Click the icon to start/reveal the team words to the Codemasters


Feature Roadmap:

- More words to choose from
- Add websockets so people can play online together
- Find a more elegant solution to communicate each team's words to the Codemaster. Maybe highlight the words?
- More feedback in the CM view to see what words have been selected

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
